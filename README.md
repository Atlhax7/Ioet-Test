# Ioet-Test
Exercise from Ioet
The code was written in java. The IDe that I used was Netbeans 8.1. I know it's a bit old but the IDe is working on my laptop from 2012.
 The package Exercise has the main code for this exercise to work. It has embedded code that works with burned code. and a JoptionPane
 That accepts one string that must be the path of the input text file with the data. The code is divided by objects and methods. It's a smaller form of MVC but without the layer of data coming from a database. And I put most of the methods on a Junit Test but I'm not fully familiar with it so maybe a few are not as good as they should be
